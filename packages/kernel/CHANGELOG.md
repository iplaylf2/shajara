# @shajara/kernel

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- da8f8bc: Align package publishing with the Yarn 4 monorepo workflow.

  This release switches package publication back to Yarn workspace publishing,
  so the published manifests are prepared through `yarn npm publish` with the
  same workspace-aware behavior used by the repository locally.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 99e73f4: Prepare the first public release of `@shajara/kernel` and `@shajara/host`.

  This release publishes the initial package surfaces for the kernel runtime,
  structured concurrency primitives, and the host-layer operations API.
